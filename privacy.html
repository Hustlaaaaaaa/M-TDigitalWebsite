                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>M&TDigital we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile applications: PsychRef, Lumiere, and Psychoanalytica (collectively, the "Apps").</p>
                    
                    <h2>Information Collection and Usage</h2>
                    <p>Each of our Apps has a distinct approach to information collection and usage, tailored to its specific functionality:</p>

                    <p><strong>PsychRef</strong> is designed to operate without collecting any personal data. There is no requirement for user registration or sign-in, and we do not track or store any usage data. Additionally, PsychRef does not utilize cookies or similar technologies, ensuring complete anonymity and privacy for the user.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lumiere</strong> processes all interactions and data locally on your device, meaning no personal information is collected, stored, or shared. The app does not transmit any data to external servers, and you retain full control over your information, with the option to delete your data by uninstalling the app or using its data management features.</p>

                    <p><strong>Psychoanalytica</strong> may require certain personally identifiable information, such as your email address and name, primarily for account creation and customer support. Additionally, it analyzes journal entries using GPT-4o to provide insights. As such, your journal entry data is sent to the OpenAI servers through their API. We employ encryption protocols when storing the journal entries and their contents are not visible to anyone but yourself.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We prioritize the security of your information across all our Apps. For PsychRef and Lumiere, data remains entirely on your device, safeguarded by your device’s security measures. For Psychoanalytica, we use robust encryption protocols to protect both your personal information and journal entries from unauthorized access.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Data Sharing and Third-Party Access</h2>
                    <p>None of our Apps sell or rent personal information to third parties. PsychRef and Lumiere do not collect any data, thereby eliminating the possibility of data sharing. Psychoanalytica, on the other hand, only shares information with third parties under specific circumstances, such as when analyzing your journal entries with GPT-4o.</p>

                    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Our Apps, including Psychoanalytica, are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under this age. If you become aware that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review this policy regularly. The updates will take effect immediately upon posting.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
